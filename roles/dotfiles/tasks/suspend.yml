# Change sleep state from Suspend-to-Idle to Suspend-to-RAM
# (change mem_sleep from "s2idle" to "deep")
#
# Reason:
# My laptop has a big problem when s2idle is enabled and bluetooth is turned on.
# After waking up from sleep, the root filesystem is mounted in read-only mode
# and nothing works properly.
# - Gnome icons disappear.
# - Running any command in ZSH results in "Input/output error".
# - I can't open any app.
# - I can't even power off or restart the system gracefully.
# After investigation, I found out that the problem disappears when I turn off
# the bluetooth. But this is not a good solution because I want to use the bluetooth.
# I read the "Power Management" article on Arch wiki, and tried to change the suspend
# method. It worked!
#
# $ cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
# [s2idle] deep
#
# This output means "s2idle" and "deep" are supported and s2idle is enabled.
#
# $ sudo echo "deep" > /sys/power/mem_sleep
# $ cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
# s2idle [deep]
#
# The problem is gone by changing sleep state to "deep" (Suspend-to-RAM).
